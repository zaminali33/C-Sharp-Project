University Card System is a simple C# console-based application designed to manage university card requests.
The program takes user information such as name and ID, then allows the user to select their status (Student, Faculty, or Ex-Student) and choose a card type (ID Card, Library Card, or Access Card).

Based on the selected status and card type, the system automatically calculates the required fee.
Students and faculty members receive free or discounted cards, while ex-students are charged higher fees.
If a fee is applicable, the program also asks for the preferred payment method (Cash or Card).

Finally, the system displays a complete summary of the card request and confirms successful processing.
This project demonstrates the use of conditional statements, user input, and console output in C#.
